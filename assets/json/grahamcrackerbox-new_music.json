                    "description" : "Brooklyn's Rex made an incredible leap forward from its lackluster first album to C, its second and best. Stretching out over 70 minutes, the album is a lush, almost lethargic showcase for singer/guitarist Curtis Harvey's sad songs. Front-loaded with the band's best songs (the stunning Morning and Ride Home) and brimming over with tasteful string arrangements, C seems to be the record Rex had been trying to make since its inception. Hypnotic and repetitive -- but engaging rather than boring because of it -- this grouping of songs would inspire slowcore imitators, but wouldn't be matched. (from allmusic.com)"
